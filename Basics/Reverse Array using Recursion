'''You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Note: Modify the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.'''


#Solution:

class Solution:
    def reverseArray(self, arr):
        left=0
        right=len(arr)-1
        arr1=arr
        
        
        def reverse(left,right,arr1):
            if(left>=(len(arr1)//2)):
                return
            a=arr1[left]
            arr1[left]=arr1[right]
            arr1[right]=a
            reverse(left+1,right-1,arr1)
        reverse(left,right,arr1)
        return arr1
